# Mergd: The Sketch<->Github Client

Mergd is an attempt to bridge the gap between Github and the git command line for designers.

**This project is in alpha, meaning it is not ready for general consumption and is not feature complete.**

## Tech

Mergd is built with Electron, an open-source application platform. It uses Sketch's plugin architecture and GitHub's API to enable Sketch to talk directly with GitHub, to provide a visual comparison of artboards from different branches or versions, and to enable designers to work directly with developers in an agile pipeline.
